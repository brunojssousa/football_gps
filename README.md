# 📍 GPS Data Analysis and Dashboard  

This repository contains a **Power BI dashboard** and a **Jupyter Notebook** for processing, analyzing, and visualizing GPS data. It was developed as part of the **Cruyff Institute's Sports Data Analytics course**.  

## 🏆 Project Objective  

This project focuses on **analyzing GPS tracking data in sports** to gain insights into athlete movement, performance, and workload. The key objectives include:  

- **Tracking movement patterns** during training sessions or matches.  
- **Measuring speed, distance covered, and acceleration** to evaluate performance.  
- **Visualizing positional data** on interactive maps.  
- **Identifying trends** in workload and effort over time.
